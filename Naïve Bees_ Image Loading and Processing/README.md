### Project 1: Na√Øve Bees: Image Loading and Processing

**Project Description:**

This project addresses the task of distinguishing between honey bees and bumble bees in images, with the potential to streamline field data collection for researchers. The focus is on leveraging the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. The project covers common image transformations and their integration into a coherent pipeline.

This is the first installment of a series that explores image data manipulation, and it serves as a foundation for subsequent projects involving traditional classification techniques and deep learning for computer vision.
