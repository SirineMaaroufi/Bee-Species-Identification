### Project 3: Na√Øve Bees: Deep Learning with Images

**Project Description:**

In this project, the focus shifts to deep learning for bee species identification. A simple yet effective deep learning model is constructed to automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images. The implementation involves libraries like keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy. The project also introduces pre-trained models and their evaluation.

Project 3 marks the culmination of a series exploring image data manipulation, traditional classification techniques, and the integration of deep learning concepts for computer vision applications.
