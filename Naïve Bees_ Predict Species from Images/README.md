### Project 2: Na√Øve Bees: Predict Species from Images

**Project Description:**

Building on the previous project, this project delves deeper into image manipulation and classification techniques. It involves loading, manipulating, and analyzing image data using the Pillow library. The goal is to develop a model capable of classifying honey bees and bumble bees based on input images.

This project is the second part of a series that gradually delves into image data handling, traditional classification methods, and the application of deep learning principles in the realm of computer vision.
